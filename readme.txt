Remove overhead from the <head> HTML, speed up your website and disable widgets you don't use

== Description ==

A standard WP installation contains many links in the head of your HTML (which slow down your site) and has standard widgets you might never use. You can now install this plugin and check the items you want to have removed. The saved options are cached for better performance.

Header items you can remove:
* Remove RSD / EditURI Link
* Remove WLW Manifest Link
* Remove RSS Feed Links
* Remove Next & Prev Post Links
* Remove Shortlink URL (also from http headers)
* Remove WP Generator Meta
* Remove Version Numbers from Style and Script Links
* Disable WP Emoji / emoticons
* Disable JSON API
* Disable Canonical URL
* Remove WooCommerce Generator Meta
* Remove jQuery Migrate script
* Disable XML-RPC methods that require authentication
* Remove all scripts and styles added by Gutenberg (in case you still use the classic editor)

You can disable the following widgets:
* Archives
* Calendar
* Categories
* Links
* Meta
* Nav Menu
* Pages
* Recent Comments
* Recent Posts
* RSS
* Search
* Tag Cloud
* Text
